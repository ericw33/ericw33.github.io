      <h4 >Summary</h4>
      <p >
        Eric grew up in the Washington, DC metro area.  He attended Walt Whitman High School and then went to the University of Rochester for college, where he studied Political Science, Ethics, and Business.  (An uncommon combination!).  From there, he went to work at Columbia Books & Information Services in Bethesda, where he started as a Product Manager and later worked as Director of Operations.  Now, he is an MBA candidate at Kellogg.

      <h4 id="every-other-h4">Professional Experience</h4>
         <p>I am currently pursuing my MBA from the Kellogg School of Management with an expected graduation in June of 2016. At Kellogg, I'm focused on refining my hard skills and gaining broad exposure to current and future executives across a wide variety of industries.</p>

          <p>I have experience as a general manager of a fast-growing company, Columbia Books & Information Services (CBIS).  CBIS is a business to business publishing company focused primarily on compliance publications and online databases in a number of niche areas, including human resources, government relations, nonprofits, and federal grants.</p>

          <p>I served as head of operations, responsible for growing the core operational infrastructure of the firm while simultaneously leading us through two significant acquisitions which resulted in significant growth of the company.  I built out our accounting/finance, technology, and human resources department to allow them to support our rapidly growing business.  I oversaw our customer service department in two offices, and was responsible for managing offices in three states.  I managed our relationship with overseas technology support vendors while identifying areas for process improvement to create significant operating cost-savings.  I led the due-diligence and integration processes for our major acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Previously, I worked in a product management role, overseeing all aspects of our U.S. Congress Handbook and Lobbyists.info brands.  I was responsible for both direct sales and product development, identifying areas to for new product creation to support the needs of our customers and then working with our developers to create those products. </p>
